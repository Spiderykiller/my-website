                My name is Beemnet Tilahun Abegaz, and I am a third-year Computer Engineering student at Addis Ababa University with a growing passion for building solutions that bridge ideas and impact. Alongside my academic journey, I work as a full-stack developer, where I explore the practical side of technology and how it can be used to solve real problems.
                Curiosity has always been the compass of my learning. From an early age, I was fascinated by the power of technology—not just as a tool, but as a force that can transform lives and communities. This curiosity pushed me to go beyond the classroom and seek opportunities where I could innovate, experiment, and contribute.
                Beyond my coursework, I have gained hands-on experience in areas such as blockchain development and peer tutoring. These experiences taught me the importance of critical thinking, collaboration, and purposeful leadership. Whether I am working on a new project or mentoring others, I thrive in environments that challenge me to grow continuously while contributing to something larger than myself.
                Looking ahead, I am excited to be part of communities that value initiative, creativity, and impact. For me, technology is not only about building systems but also about creating opportunities for people—and that is the journey I am committed to pursuing.
